🧠 Business Insights
💡 1. Month-to-Month contracts have the highest churn

Customers with no long-term commitment leave more often.

💡 2. Higher Monthly Charges → Higher Churn

Price-sensitive customers tend to switch providers.

💡 3. Fiber Optic Internet users churn more

Possible due to service issues or pricing.

💡 4. Electronic Check payments show high churn

Users paying through electronic check are less loyal.

🏁 Conclusion
This analysis helps business teams target:

   Customers with monthly contracts

   High-billing customers

   Fiber optic internet users

   Electronic check payment users

   Targeted offers, discounts, or contract upgrades can reduce churn significantly.
